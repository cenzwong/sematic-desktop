Introduction

## Your Handbook

This is your colleague handbook, and it has been created to help guide you through the key employment and job related information you need to know whilst working here at Asda. If the full detail isn't found within the handbook, we direct you to where you can find out more.

You should read and familiarise yourself with the content of your colleague handbook, which includes information on a range of areas including your contractual terms and conditions, how we reward you, how we keep you safe and legal and our key policies.

Our policies do change from time to time, so make sure you use the People Policies page on the colleague intranet to find the most up to date version. It is your responsibility to ensure that, when changes are made to policies, you familiarise yourself with the most current information.

Where the handbook talks about your line manager, this means the individual responsible for day to day management activity within your department. This could be a Team Leader or the manager on duty in your place of work on any particular  day.

Some colleague admin activity is carried out by our HR Shared Service Team, they can be contacted on 0113 291 9000.

## Asda's Purpose

To bring brighter living within everyone's reach

It's the reason why we exist and is our north star for everything we do.

## Asda's Core Values

1. We put customers at the heart of everything
2. We dare to try
3. We don't wait to make good stuff happen
4. We love what we sell
5. We are all colleagues, together one team

## Diversity and Inclusion

People are very much at the heart of our business and we're really proud that Asda is made up of so many unique individuals - it's what makes us so special.

Respecting each other and our differences is crucial to maintaining our fantastic culture. Having diverse teams is not just the right thing to do, it also helps us to understand our customers better, meaning we can offer great customer service.

Diversity and inclusion are a key focus at Asda - it is every colleague's responsibility to create an environment where colleagues are not only entitled to equality but are awarded equality in an environment where they can truly be themselves.

We have dedicated groups of colleagues from around the business who focus on promoting diversity in key areas, such as Disability, LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender), Gender, Age and Ethnicity. Further information about just how important diversity and inclusion is to Asda and the responsibilities of each colleague can be found in the Diversity and Inclusion Policy.

## Colleague Communication

Great communication plays a key part in the success of Asda, so we use different methods to make sure you are kept up to date with what's going on in the business and given the chance to say what you think. We have a culture of involving all of our colleagues in everything we do, regardless of where in the business you work.

At Asda we understand the importance of listening to your feedback and acting on it. By engaging with our colleagues, we ensure that our values and culture are embedded in everything we do. That's why each year you will have the opportunity to complete Your Voice, an anonymous survey, where you can share open and honest feedback about the leaders within the business so that we can ensure we are always doing the right thing. Depending on the department you work in, some colleagues may be invited to complete the global version of this survey.

To find out about how information is communicated in your place of work, speak to your line manager.

Your Contractual Terms and Conditions of Employment

## Your Contractual Terms and Conditions

Your offer letter (and any subsequent contract change letters), together with the following sections in this handbook, form your main terms and conditions of employment:

| •   | Other Employment                   |     |                           |

They also constitute your statement of employment particulars which you are entitled to under the Employment Rights Act 1996. This handbook also contains lots of information about Asda policies and non-contractual benefits which do not form part of your terms and conditions of employment.

## Changes to the Colleague Handbook

Asda reserves the right to review, amend, remove, or replace the content of this handbook, amend existing policies and / or introduce new policies from time to time to reflect the changing needs of  the  business and  /  or  to  comply  with  legal  developments. Copies of  this handbook are available from OneAsda.

It is your responsibility to keep yourself up to date with any changes by attending meetings, huddles and by familiarising yourself with any changes communicated via any Home Office online communications. Further information on the policies referred to in this handbook can be found on OneAsda. Please see your line manager if you have any queries.

## Changes to Personal Circumstances

You are responsible for updating OneAsda with any changes to your personal circumstances such as your marital status or civil partner status, contact details, name, next of kin, telephone number or address, so we are able to amend our records (some changes may require evidence to be provided).

If  you  change your marital status and you do not notify us of this, you may be asked to make good any incorrect national insurance deductions made through the payroll. Inaccurate records may also affect you receiving important information or the correct benefits.

You must inform your Line Manager immediately if  your  immigration status affecting  your right to work in the UK changes (see below).

## Right to Work

All colleagues who join Asda are asked to produce documents that prove that they have the right to work in the UK. This is a legal requirement. If the documentation only provides a temporary right to work, this will need to be reviewed regularly. The documentation required will be explained during the recruitment process. If you have a temporary right to work in the UK then it is your responsibility to keep this up to date. If it is found that your right to work has expired then you may be suspended without pay until you can produce a valid document that will allow you to work legally within the UK.

Failure to produce these documents may result in the offer of employment being withdrawn or your employment being terminated. For further information see the Right to Work Policy and supporting documents.

## Probationary Period

We have a 12 week probationary period for all colleagues joining Asda, which is in place to see whether you are able to meet the standards for the job. During these 12 weeks you will have regular one to ones with your line manager (and more detailed reviews in weeks four, eight and 12). Please ensure that you book these reviews with your line manager.

It may be that after training and coaching you are unable to meet the required standards. We hope that all our new colleagues will have a successful probationary period, however, at this point we can decide to end your employment with Asda. If this decision is made within your first 12 weeks, one week's notice is required.

## References

We take up references for every new colleague. Should we receive one, whether within your probationary period or later, which contradicts information which you have provided, and / or which in our opinion is unsatisfactory, then Asda may terminate your employment immediately, observing the appropriate notice period. This may also be the case if we are unable to obtain a satisfactory reference. For further information see the References Policy.

## Confidentiality

During and after your employment with Asda you must make sure that all confidential information is held in the strictest confidence and is not disclosed to any other person, even another Asda colleague except where you have to tell them so that they can carry out their job.

Where you  work  in  a  team  that  handles  information  relating  to  Asda's  customers,  colleagues, or any other individuals you must treat all such information in the strictest confidence. Accessing, using, or disclosing confidential information, other than for legitimate business purposes and the proper performance of your job, will be taken very seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.

Confidential information means:

- any information which relates to the business including the finances, commercial agreements, affairs, marketing, products, services, property and plans or proposals for business development or growth or other activities of Asda or any supplier of Asda which is designated as confidential; and
- any information relating to such matters which came to your knowledge in the course of your employment with Asda and which, by reason of its character and / or the manner of its coming to your knowledge, is evidently confidential; and
- any information relating to Asda's customers, colleagues, or any other individuals

## Punctuality

All colleagues are expected to arrive for work on time and lateness must be avoided. Persistent lateness will be monitored, and colleagues may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.

## Suspension

Suspension  from  the  business  will  only  happen  in  certain  situations,  where  it  is  deemed  to  be absolutely necessary and as a last resort. The decision to suspend will be taken by a suitable manager following the completion of a suspension risk assessment as outlined in the policy.

Where appropriate it may be necessary to take steps to remove the colleague from the risk  as  an alternative  to  suspension,  which  may  mean  that  you  are  temporarily  moved  into another role while an investigation is carried out. Further information on suspension and the circumstances in which it might be used can be found in the Suspension Policy.

## Other Employment

Whilst working at Asda, you must not, without first getting our written consent, be employed in any capacity or for any purpose whatsoever by any other person or company; this includes carrying out business on your own account. In addition you must inform us of any change to your other employment previously notified to us.

Your Working Week

## What is my working week?

Your hours of work will be those specified in your offer letter. The days and work pattern will be as notified by your manager.

Colleagues are expected to work such extra hours as deemed necessary to enable duties to be carried out satisfactorily. Home Offices colleagues are responsible for ensuring that they monitor their working hours. Under the Working Time Directive colleagues should not exceed an average of 48 hours per week over a 17 week reference period. As well as meeting the requirements of the Working Time Directive, monitoring our colleagues' working hours helps us to ensure that you are able to achieve a work life fit and are not compromising your welfare or health and safety at work.

## Will I ever be required to undertake different duties?

As well as the normal duties associated with your job, you may be required to undertake other duties which fall within your capabilities, dependant on the needs of the business. We encourage our colleagues to multi-skill. The requirements of our customers must come first. Under normal circumstances we would prefer not to ask you to carry out tasks with which you are not familiar. However, we may ask you to do other types of activity, which are not covered by your particular role profile. Full training will be given where necessary.

## Holidays

## Statutory Minimum Holiday Entitlement

The statutory minimum holiday entitlement for all colleagues is 28 days in each holiday year for those contracted to work five days a week (pro-rata for part-time colleagues).

This  means  that  all  colleagues  have  a  statutory  entitlement  to  take  at  least  5.6  weeks'  paid  leave  away from work each holiday year (a week means your weekly contracted hours). The statutory minimum holiday entitlement is not in addition to the paid leave entitlement set out in the Holiday section of the handbook.

## What counts towards your statutory minimum holiday entitlement?

The following types of paid leave make up your holiday entitlement:

- Your base holiday entitlement which is determined by your length of service with Asda and your grade
- Your floating day
- Your bank holiday entitlement

## What is my base holiday entitlement?

| Continuous service   |   Grade / Zone D and C |   Grade / Zone B and above |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0 years < 3 years    |                     24 |                         25 |
| 3 years < 10 years   |                     25 |                         26 |
| 10 years < 15 years  |                     26 |                         27 |
| 15 years < 20 years  |                     27 |                         28 |
| 20 years < 25 years  |                     28 |                         29 |
| *25 years and over   |                     29 |                         30 |

(Pro-rata for part-time colleagues)

* Colleagues who reach their 25 th  year of service receive an extra week's holiday within the year in which their anniversary falls.

Colleagues who reach a service anniversary which moves them from one level of entitlement to the next have the extra day's holiday added at the start of the following holiday year, not the year in which the anniversary date falls.

Asda's holiday year begins on 1 st  April and ends on 31 st  March.

If you join Asda part way through the holiday year, your holiday entitlement during your first year of employment will be calculated on a pro-rata basis.

In the event a colleague is on suspension during a period where they have a previously booked holiday, they would be removed from paid suspension, given their booked holiday and associated pay. On return from the booked holiday they would then be put back on paid suspension. This would only happen in the event that the colleague is unavailable to meet with us due to the holiday. However, if a colleague, who is on suspension, has booked holiday but is willing to attend meetings with Asda during this period they would continue to be on paid suspension. They could then take their holiday at a later date.

## How do I book leave?

All leave must be booked in advance giving a reasonable amount of notice and must be approved by your line manager.

Where you request two or more consecutive weeks of leave in any holiday year, you should give a minimum of three months' notice in advance of the requested dates to your line manager, to ensure your best chance of getting the time off you would like.

Leave requests will be authorised depending on departmental cover and operational requirements.

It is your responsibility to ensure your holiday entitlement is taken. Payment in lieu of holiday not taken will not be made and holiday may not be carried over into the next holiday year.

## Floating Day

All colleagues are entitled to a floating day to be taken between 1 st  November and 31 st  March. Floating day requests must be authorised by your line manager and are dependent on departmental cover and operational requirements.

## Bank Holiday Working and Pay

For the purpose of this handbook the term customary holiday and bank holiday mean the same thing and will be referred to as bank holidays throughout.

## What is a bank holiday?

The bank holidays recognised by Asda are as follows:

## England and Wales

- New Year's Day
- Good Friday
- Easter Monday
- May Day
- Spring bank holiday
- Late Summer
- Christmas Day

## · Boxing Day

- Local bank holiday (typically July / August)
- Local Autumn bank holiday (typically October / November)
- Christmas Day
- Boxing Day*

*Colleagues in Scotland recognise either Boxing Day or 2 nd  January as their bank holiday. All colleagues who joined Asda on or after 1 st  July 2011 recognise Boxing Day as their bank holiday and not 2 nd January.

## Northern Ireland

- New Year's Day
- Easter Monday
- Easter Tuesday
- St Patrick's Day 17 th  March
- July bank holiday
- Summer bank holiday
- Christmas Day
- Boxing Day

Easter Sunday is not a bank holiday.

## Bank Holiday Entitlement

All colleagues are entitled to eight bank holidays per year. For part-time colleagues, bank holidays will be taken on a pro-rata basis. Your line manager will provide details of your bank holiday entitlement at the start of each year.

## What happens to my holiday pay when I leave?

On termination of employment, any holiday pay due to you will be paid. This will be the balance of holiday earned but not taken as at your leaving date.

When a colleague has taken more holiday than they have accrued at the point of leaving, the balance will be recovered from final monies. Holiday earned is calculated on a daily basis.

Any overpayment like this will be recovered from any final monies due from Asda to the colleague.

Colleagues will need to make arrangements to pay back to Asda any amounts in respect of holiday taken in excess of holiday earned at the point of leaving which are not recovered from final monies due from Asda.

## Notice Periods

Notice which you are required to give and are entitled to receive from Asda:

| Grade/ Zone               | Continuous Service                                           | Notice Required from you and Asda                                                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zone D/C                  | Up to 3 months service 3 months < 4 years 4 years < 12 years | 1 week 4 weeks 4 weeks, plus a week per extra year's service to a maximum of 12 weeks |
| C10's on branch code 8323 | From day 1                                                   | 3 months                                                                              |
| Zone B                    | Up to 3 months service 3 months and above                    | 1 week 3 months                                                                       |
| Zone A                    | Up to 3 months service 3 months and above                    | 1 week 6 months                                                                       |

The notice periods referenced above apply to colleagues on a permanent contract. Notice periods for colleagues on a fixed term contract may differ and will be set out in the offer letter. In the event there is any inconsistency between the information in the above table and the terms in the offer letter, the offer letter will take precedence.

Notice may be given to either party on any day of the week in writing. Notice periods will normally be worked but Asda may waive the requirement to work all or part of the notice.

Once either  party  has  given  notice,  Asda  has  the  discretion  to  exclude  colleagues  from  Asda premises where they work, for all or part of their notice. During the part of a colleague's notice period where they are excluded  from  Asda premises,  colleagues will  retain all of  their contractual pay and service and still be subject to their  contractual  terms e.g.  confidentiality etc. until their notice period  ends.

Asda has the discretion to ask colleagues during their notice period to carry out duties which may differ from their normal duties or to refrain from carrying out any duties.

If by agreement with Asda that it is of mutual benefit to negotiate a reduced notice period, Asda will pay for the reduced notice period only.

Colleagues can request to retract their notice once it has been submitted and received, however, once notice has been issued by a colleague and received by Asda, Asda reserves the right to accept the notice and your employment would end in line with that notice.

Your employment may be terminated by Asda summarily without notice in the event of gross misconduct or if you commit a serious breach of your obligations as an Asda colleague.

## How We Reward You

## Contractual and Additional Payment

## How do I get paid?

You will be paid every four weeks directly into your bank or building society account. It is your responsibility to ensure that your correct bank or building society details are recorded on OneAsda. If your details are incorrect or if you do not provide them when asked to do so, it may result in your pay being delayed.

If you have a query regarding your pay, it is important that you raise this with your line manager. In cases when your line manager cannot resolve your query you should refer it to HR Shared Service.

In the unlikely event that an overpayment is made to you in error, this will be recovered at the earliest opportunity (i.e. usually the next pay day), and this will normally be discussed with you. In some cases the recovery may be referred to a third party company to handle.

## If I leave Asda what will I be paid?

All monies owing to you less any deductions mentioned below will be paid into your bank or building society account the following pay day at the end of your notice period. However, if your notice ends in the week that you are paid, your final monies will be paid to you on the pay day thereafter and as your P45 can only be issued after your final pay, there may be an unavoidable delay of up to five weeks before you receive your final pay and P45.

If you fail to serve and / or work your contractual notice period you will be paid for the period of notice worked only. In the event of any absence due to illness during your notice period, we reserve the right at our absolute discretion not to pay all or any part of Company Sick Pay which may be due.

To understand what happens to your outstanding holiday pay when you leave, refer to the section on Holidays.

## Deductions from Pay

Asda reserves the right to make deductions from your pay or other monies due to you from Asda, or to require you to repay money to Asda in relation to:

- Overpayment of holiday pay
- Overpayment of sick pay
- Overpayment of expenses claimed by you
- Overpayment of any other payment made to you by Asda
- Interim payments made to you by Asda
- Any money due to Asda from you, including any pay  errors
- Any money requested by you in writing to be deducted
- Any cost incurred by Asda as a result of you agreeing but then failing to attend a prearranged occupational health appointment
- Replacement cost of non-returned company property
- Training fees incurred by Asda which are subject to a pay-back provision
- Relocation expenses

## Sick Pay

## What pay will I receive whilst I am absent because of illness?

Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is paid to all colleagues who qualify. If absent through illness, you must claim SSP by using the correct procedure, as outlined in the Sick Pay Policy. The rules governing SSP are laid down by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

Company Sick Pay (CSP - also known as Occupational Sick Pay or OSP) makes up the payments made under SSP rules to your normal contractual rate of pay. The number of weeks for which CSP is paid will depend on your zone and length of service (refer to the section 'How does CSP entitlement work').

If you do not qualify for SSP because your earnings are below the lower earnings level, then you will receive CSP to the level of your normal contractual rate of pay. The National Insurance Contributions lower earnings level is set by the DWP and is reviewed annually. For the current rates please speak to HR Shared Service.

The number of weeks for which CSP is paid will depend upon your grade and length of service. When you are absent from work, once HR Shared Service have received the necessary documentation, a sick pay claim will be made for you. Any payment of SSP or CSP due will be shown on your pay slip. If you are not eligible for SSP for any reason you will be sent an SSP1 form direct from our third party payroll provider which includes a claim form for Incapacity Benefit with full instructions. On receipt of the SSP1 you should contact the Department for Work and Pensions.

## What are the SSP pay rules?

Under SSP rules, two periods of sickness absence for the same reason which are separated by eight weeks (56 calendar days) or less, are said to be linked. This means that they count together as a single period of incapacity for work.

Asda will pay SSP for the first 28 weeks of a period of absence.

## How does CSP entitlement work?

The CSP year runs from 6 th  April and sick pay entitlement is related to grade and continuous service as shown below. If you have new periods of absence which occur within the same year, this would be deducted from the entitlement shown. Any unused entitlement will not be carried forward into a new CSP year. The linking period for CSP is two weeks (14 calendar days).

| Grade / Zone   | Service Qualifications                           | Duration of Payments      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Zone D         | Up to 2 years 2 years < 5 years 5 years and over | 8 weeks 12 weeks 14 weeks |
| Zone C / B     | Nil                                              | 17 weeks                  |
| Zone A & above | Nil                                              | 26 weeks                  |

When sick pay entitlement starts or increases, the new entitlement is pro-rata to the balance of that CSP year. If you do not qualify for this entitlement until after the start of the CSP year then your  CSP will  be  pro-rated,  reflecting  the  number  of  months  remaining  of  that  CSP  year.

When CSP has expired, if you continue to be absent into the start of a new sick pay year, you will not receive a new yearly entitlement. This will only happen once you have returned to work and if you are absent again later in the year after the CSP linking period.

## Which days are considered for payment?

Only complete days of sickness absence are considered for sick pay purposes. Any work done on a work day / shift that extends over midnight is treated as worked on the first of the two days. For the first seven calendar days of an absence, you should complete a self-certificate form, which is available from the OneAsda and should be returned to HR Shared Service.

A medical certificate  from  a  GP  must  be  provided  for  absences  of  more  than  seven  calendar days. This must be given to HR Shared Service on the eighth day of absence.

If a certificate is not provided on time to cover your absence, this may result in the AWOL procedure being invoked. We may ask, in exceptional circumstances, for a medical certificate to be provided for absences of less than seven days. If a charge is incurred from your GP for the provision of this, we will refund the cost to you.

Sick pay always takes precedence over bereavement, paternity, holidays, suspension, and many other payments that you might otherwise be entitled to receive. You can take annual holiday whilst absent from work on sick leave but cannot be paid both holiday pay and sick pay for the same period of time. The holiday booking and authorisation process must be followed as usual for any requests (refer to the section on Holidays).

If your sick pay has expired and you are still unfit to return to work, but have outstanding holiday entitlement, you may wish to book the holiday leave. There are set procedures to follow in order to do this and it may have an adverse impact on any benefits you may be receiving. If you are in receipt of any statutory benefits, it is your responsibility to notify the relevant authority. For further advice speak to your Line Manager.

It is important that you do not delay notifying your sickness absence, as this can result in your sick pay being delayed. Any period of absence not covered by a fit note when one is needed cannot be processed for sick claims, therefore you will not receive any sick pay if you do not provide the relevant fit notes.

## When may CSP be withheld?

- Any period  of  sickness  absence  which  is  caused  by  any  other  employment  undertaken by you, by not following company rules, or where it is self-inflicted
- Unreasonable refusal to undertake an independent medical examination at Asda's expense, in cases where it is considered necessary
- If you are absent from work because of illness during all or any part of a period of investigation into suspected misconduct (whether or not you have been suspended), whilst disciplinary proceedings are pending, or you are being formally performance managed
- Unreasonable refusal to attend or be visited during your normal working day, or if you fail to respond to requests to contact a manager or attend a meeting to discuss your progress · Unreasonable refusal to accept alternative duties
- Cosmetic surgery that is not for medical reasons, such as a breast enlargement or nose reduction
- In situations where you are held in legal custody or participating in industrial  action
- The period during pregnancy known as the disqualification period

- If you have a significant period of absence which reoccurs year after year and (following Occupational Health advice) Asda believes the illness is not genuine
- If  you  resign  or  are  served  notice  and  produce a  medical  certificate during  your notice period
- Unreasonable refusal to comply with the absence procedure

In cases where you are able to claim against a third party and / or insurance policy, e.g. road accident or sporting injury, you must make a claim for compensation, or you will not be entitled to CSP. Asda will pay you as though you were entitled to CSP however it will be a temporary interim payment, which you will be required to repay to Asda when compensation has been received by you. Entitlement to future CSP will then be restored to the extent of the interim repayment made.

## Asda Pension Plan

Asda has a pensions plan in place to help you to save for the future. The Asda Pension Plan has two sections, the Start section automatically enrols you into the plan and the Step Up section provides the option for you to increase the amount you save.

Further details are available on the Asda Pension Plan website at www.land g .com/asdapensionplan

Asda reserves the right to change the terms of, replace or terminate these pension arrangements at any time. Also, there may be changes in legislation that change how they operate.

The Asda Pension Plan is run in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules, which may vary from time to time. The details below are a summary of the benefits provided by the Plan, but in the event of any difference between the summary and the Trust Deed and Rules, the Trust Deed and Rules will always apply.

## Start Section

When you first join Asda we will look to see if you meet the conditions for automatic enrolment into the Asda Pension Plan. These conditions are that you are aged 22 or over, below State Pension Age, and that you earn more than a certain amount each pay period (the Government changes this amount each year). If you meet these conditions for three pay periods and you have not already joined the Step Up section, you will be automatically enrolled in the Start section of the Asda Pension Plan. This is a legal requirement. After you have been enrolled you will have a choice of remaining as a member, or you can opt out.

If you do not meet the conditions for automatic enrolment, we will continue to check each pay period, and if you meet the conditions in the future you will be automatically enrolled unless you have already joined the Step Up section.

Once every three years, if you have been automatically enrolled and chosen to opt-out, you will automatically be re-enrolled if you still meet the conditions and have not joined the Step Up section. You will again have the option to opt-out.

## Step Up Section

If you are a salaried colleague and aged 18 years or over, you are eligible to join the Step Up section of the Asda Pension Plan. As a Step Up member, you will pay a contribution rate of your choice and Asda will also pay a level of contribution, which will depend on your contribution amount and your job grade.

You can join the Step Up or Start section of the Asda Pension Plan at any time by completing

a joining form. You can get this form from the Asda Pension Team by calling 0113 826 4854 or by emailing pensions@asda.co.uk

## Life Assurance

If you are not a member of the Step Up section of the Asda Pension Plan, are aged under 75 and you die whilst you are employed by Asda, you qualify for life assurance equal to one times your base pay.

If you are a member of the Step Up section of the Asda Pension Plan, are aged under 75 and you die whilst employed by Asda aged under 75 and still paying into the Plan, you qualify for life assurance equal to five times your base  pay.

Asda reserves the right to change or stop the scheme at any time. Also there may be changes in legislation that change how the scheme operates. For further information on Life Assurance speak to your People Manager or the Pensions Team.

## Bonus

Here at Asda, our discretionary bonus scheme is available for all eligible colleagues to participate in. In order to be eligible, you must have three months' continuous service at the end of the bonus year (31 st  December). Also, to qualify for a bonus payment you must still be employed, not have resigned, served notice, or been served notice to terminate your employment as at the date the bonus is actually  paid.

Details of your maximum bonus opportunity will be included in your offer letter. However you do not have a contractual right to receive a bonus. Any bonus paid will be calculated according to the bonus scheme rules.

Bonus payments are at the discretion of Asda and Asda reserves the right to alter or discontinue the scheme at any time. For further information speak with your line manager or People Manger.

## Colleague Discount Card

We recognise that as well as being a valued colleague, you are also a valued customer. Once you have been employed as an Asda colleague for 12 weeks, you will be eligible to receive your Asda Walmart colleague discount card (you may also select a nominated user, subject to certain criteria).

You can obtain discount in any Asda store across the UK and any global Walmart store which operates the discount card system, subject to the scheme rules of that particular country.

A valid card entitles you to 10% discount on Asda purchases throughout the store and on george.com. Some exclusions apply. You will receive an additional 10% off all Food to Go items (normal colleague discount rules apply).

It is extremely important that you fully understand the rules and conditions relating to your discount card, which will be issued to you when you receive the card and may be amended from time to time. It is your responsibility to brief your nominated user on these rules and you are responsible for any misuse of the card by your nominated user. You may change who your nominated user is, but you must inform your line manager or People Team if you wish to do so. Home Office colleagues must inform the Reward Team.

Asda reserves the right to change or stop the scheme at any time. Any breach of the rules relating to your discount card by yourself, or your nominated user may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Further information can be found in the Colleague Discount Policy.

## Colleague Recognition Scheme

It's really important that you feel recognised for the hard work that you put and the great job that you do. It is part of our culture, and we have a scheme in place called Asda Stars, which is a great way for your fellow colleagues and managers to thank you for the effort you put into your work.

You will be awarded Asda star points when you do something that makes you shine out for the great job you've done or the great service you've delivered. It may be because you have done something that is above and beyond what is expected of you, or you may be someone who constantly delivers to a high standard.

Our website asdastars.com not only allows you to save and spend the star points you've been awarded in a range of different ways, but also lets you send free e-cards to other colleagues, family, and friends.

## Long Service

We value your commitment and loyalty at Asda. As you progress in your career we will celebrate with you along the way, particularly when you reach important milestone years. Further information on how we recognise long service can be found in the Long Service Policy.

## Healthcare

Asda provides healthcare  cover to  certain  colleagues.  If  you  are  eligible  for  healthcare  cover, you will have been notified about this in the offer letter for your current role. This is a taxable benefit, which may affect the amount of tax you pay. For further information speak with the Reward Team.

## Relocation

## Who Qualifies for Relocation?

Relocation is only available to salaried colleagues who have been requested to move by the business in a permanent role. Colleagues who change their place of work at their own request, are not eligible for relocation support. If colleagues are relocating and do not meet the criteria the colleague must get specific advice regarding their case from the colleagues People Team or Reward Team in Asda House.

## Company Car

Depending on your position and job grade, you may be entitled to a company car or cash allowance alternative (see below) details will be included in your offer letter. A company car  is  classed  as  a  'benefit  in  kind'  under  HMRC  guidelines  and  as  such,  you  will  be  subject to tax and National Insurance contributions on the value of this benefit. You should fully explore how this will apply to your specific circumstance before opting into the Company Car Scheme.

## Cash Allowance

If you opt for the cash allowance, the amount you receive will depend on your position and job grade and will be included within the pay that you receive every four weeks. Cash allowance is not subject to Pension deductions and is not included in your 'base pay' for any other calculations, such as bonus. All amounts paid are subject to normal tax and National Insurance contributions. Whilst in receipt of a cash allowance, as part of the scheme rules you are not entitled to use hire cars for company  business.

## Job Need Car

You may be allocated a job need company car due to the number of business miles you are required to travel as a requirement of your role.

## Retirement

We have a flexible approach to retirement, meaning that we will support you to continue working with no upper age limit. We simply ask you to let us know when you intend to retire, so we don't automatically assume you wish to continue working!

How We Keep You Safe and Legal

## Health and Safety Policy

The Health and Safety Policy demonstrates that we are committed to providing a safe, legal, and trusted place for our colleagues to work and our customers to shop. For further information see the policy on the colleague intranet or on the Compliance notice boards.

## Colleague Voice and Safety Committee

In locations with an elected Shop Steward, the Shop Steward carries out the statutory role of the Union Safety Representative. Shop Stewards are members of the Colleague Voice in their capacity as Safety Representative and are expected to attend the Colleague Voice meetings, where health and safety is an agenda item. In locations where there is no Shop Steward (e.g. Home Offices), Asda will recognise one nominated member as a Safety Representative who will have a seat on the Colleague Voice in that capacity. The Colleague Voice meets monthly, and you are encouraged to bring to the attention of your Colleague Voice Representative or Shop Steward any health and safety issues so they can be raised at the meeting and feedback provided.

## First Aid

We have trained first aiders to deal with injuries. First aid boxes are located around the building, and these boxes are easily identified. The names of your first aiders will normally be on display in the reception area, on an In / Out notice board or near the first aid boxes.

## Training

All colleagues will receive training for their role during Best Welcome and as part of any job- specific training. Failure to follow policies, procedures and training may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.

## Accidents and Incidents

All incidents must be reported to your line manager and recorded, even those that do not result in an injury to an individual or damage to equipment. All incidents will be investigated to determine their cause and to prevent a  recurrence. All  accidents  must be reported  through the City Helpdesk on #6199 or 0141 647 2000 at the earliest possible opportunity.

## Health and Safety Instructions

All colleagues play an essential part in maintaining safety and you must take reasonable care for the health and safety of yourself and all other individuals who may be affected by your actions.

To ensure our business remains a safe place to work and a safe place to shop, all colleagues must:

- Comply with all Asda policies and procedures
- Work in accordance with the training you have been provided at all times, and only use equipment that you have been trained on
- Report all accidents and incidents in line with Asda  Policy
- Use all protective clothing and equipment provided
- Remove any faulty equipment from use and isolate it immediately, report it to a manager and ensure that it is not used until it is repaired by a competent person
- Take responsibility for keeping your place of work clean, tidy, and safe by following Clean As You Go
- If you see something that is unsafe (e.g. blocked fire exits or a spillage on the floor) take action immediately and inform your line manager
- Set a good example, and if you see someone acting unsafely, challenge their behaviour and report it to your line manager

## Display Screen Equipment

Asda recognises its duty to comply with the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) regulations 1992, and in relation to the provision of eye tests and glasses needed solely for use when working with display screen equipment. Anyone who is defined as a Display Screen Equipment user is entitled to an eye test at Asda's expense. The frequency of such tests is every two years but can be more frequent if recommended by an optician or the colleague believes there has been significant deterioration. For further information see the Home Offices Display Screen Equipment Policy on the Compliance site on the colleague intranet.

## Food Hygiene and Safety

Every person working in a food business must maintain a high degree of personal hygiene and cleanliness and wear suitable, clean, and where appropriate, protective clothing, especially those who are open food handlers. An open food handler is anyone that works in the following areas:

- Counters / Production
- Catering (customer and colleague restaurant)
- Bakery
- Any other fresh food preparation area (e.g. Food To Go in Petrol Filling Stations). This also includes multi-skilled colleagues who may work in these areas occasionally

If you are an open food handlers you must wash your hands when entering the department and regularly throughout the day, especially after handling raw foods, visiting the toilet, cleaning, handling of rubbish or food waste, sneezing, blowing your nose, scratching your body/face and after your breaks. You will receive additional food safety training relevant to your role and responsibility.

## Use of Correct Cleaning Materials

Food premises and all articles and equipment that food comes into contact with must be kept clean and in good condition.

We will provide you with approved cleaning materials that remove dirt and grease and reduce any harmful bacteria to a safe level. Any chemicals used will be appropriate for the task and will be safe for you when used in accordance with the accompanying safety instructions and with any personal protective equipment where appropriate. No other cleaning products may be used. That includes products that are in store for sale to customers, as they will not have been risk assessed and may not be completely safe or effective. You will be trained on how to use the materials and equipment provided and must report any defects immediately.

## Challenge 20

Keeping food at the  correct  temperature is essential to ensure  its  shelf  life  and  safety.  The  '20 minute rule' must be followed by all colleagues handling chilled or frozen food. During very warm weather 20 minutes may be too long and the handling time must be reduced to an absolute minimum.

## Remember:

- Don't overload cabinets
- Follow merchandising briefs
- Close doors to back up chillers once you have finished working in them
- Merchandise the products in the right cabinets

## Date Codes

Many foods sold in our stores have a date code. It is everyone's responsibility to ensure that no foods are on sale which are beyond the indicated date. When filling up make sure you always rotate stock so that the shortest life products are at the  front.

## Pest Prevention

Pests can seriously affect food safety and they can be very difficult to eradicate once established. Prevention is better than cure, so it is best if we don't create conditions to encourage pests. Any pest concerns or pest sightings must be notified immediately to your line manager to enable the pest control company to take action without delay. Common pests to watch out for are:

- Rodents - such as rats and mice
- Flies - such as fruit flies and drain  flies
- Moths - may affect the bakery production area

## Allergens

When some food is eaten, people can have an allergic reaction. This is because the body's immune system identifies the product as a threat. There are 14 known allergens which we have to legally manage to reduce the risk of cross contamination into foods which shouldn't contain them. What can you do to reduce the risk?

- Adequate cleaning in between preparing products which contain different allergens
- Correct storage of all ingredients
- Follow policies and procedures in place

## Infectious/Contagious Diseases

If you suspect that you or any other member of your household is suffering from an infectious or contagious disease you must, in the interest of the health and safety of your fellow colleagues and the general public, inform your line manager immediately.

In these circumstances, you should consult your doctor and if necessary obtain a medical certificate. If you are eligible, the Asda Sick Pay Scheme will apply. Self-certification is not acceptable in these cases.

## Fire Safety and Prevention

You will receive fire training at your Best Welcome. It's important that you familiarise yourself with the evacuation procedure for your specific place of work straightaway, or as part of your induction, making sure you understand how to operate the green manual emergency override break glass devices.

If the fire alarm goes off:

- leave the building by  the  nearest  safe  fire  exit,  informing  any  customers  or  visitors  near to you to leave their trolley or basket and exit the building
- do not panic, run, or shout fire
- do not stop to collect any  belongings
- do not use lifts
- on your way out provide customers and visitors with assistance to ensure they safely exit the building
- make your way to the designated fire assembly point
- do not re-enter the building until you are authorised to do so by the most senior manager present in consultation with local fire authority representatives if they are in attendance

If you discover a fire:

- alert colleagues, customers, or visitors in the area
- sound the fire alarm by smashing a red break glass call point
- evacuate the building in the normal manner
- do not attempt to fight fires unless there is an immediate risk of harm to yourself or others (e.g. using a fire extinguisher  to facilitate escape from a  building in  the event of a fire)

You must always keep fire  exits and  fire  escape  routes  clear  and  unobstructed  both  internally and externally at all times, and never put yourself or others at risk.

## Security

## Access Control Systems

For the safety and security of colleagues and visitors, card operated access control systems are used in all Asda home offices. The card you are issued is unique to you and must not be used by anyone else. It is important that you do not give your card to others for them to use, as this  will  be  taken  extremely  seriously  and  may  result  in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.  Any  visitors  you  have  must  report  immediately  to  reception  on arrival, where they will be provided with a temporary visitor card.

## Colleagues Against Theft

We believe that Asda employs honest and hardworking people. However, if you notice anything that brings into question another colleague's honesty, you must raise this with the Security Team and your line manager. You can also share any ideas and suggestions with them on how we might be able to reduce loss in the business, e.g. information about shoplifters or simple ways we can do things differently.

You can also speak confidentially and anonymously to our independent third party helpline on 0800 318 405, who will pass the information on to the Senior Director of Operational Security.

## Counterfeit, Stolen and Duty Free (Imported) Goods

At Asda we do not allow colleagues to sell or distribute counterfeit, stolen or duty free (imported) goods for reward or benefit on company premises. If you are found to have taken part in such activity, it will be taken very seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Counterfeit goods are goods that have been reproduced without the owner's consent and include items such as music CDs, DVDs, clothing, and perfumes.

## Parking

Limited free of charge parking is provided at most Asda home office locations for colleagues to use on a first  come  first  served basis.  Your  vehicle  is parked at  your  own  risk and  Asda does not accept liability for loss or damage to vehicles or other property left in the car park. Asda is  not  responsible for any parking costs incurred at your main place of work. However where your job requires you to travel to a store, depot work or office location where parking has to be paid for this may be claimed back. For further information see the Parking and Travel and Expenses Policies.

## Personal  Property

We advise you not to bring valuables into work because despite our best efforts, it is not always possible to guarantee security.  Any personal items you do bring to work must be stored  securely. If  personal  items  are  stolen  or  damaged,  Asda  will  not  be  responsible.

## Spot Checks and Searches

You may be asked to take part in a spot check, where your drawers, cupboards, clothing, vehicles etc. are searched. Checks will be conducted by managers and with your co-operation can be done quickly and with as little disruption as possible. Refusal to co-operate with a spot check will be viewed very seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Further information can be found in the Spot Check Policy.

## Supporting your Safety

We do everything we can to make Asda a safe place to work. Here are some tips on what to do in an emergency:

- What to do if there's an incident at work - Dial 999 (or 101 if it's not an emergency). If it's Asda related, speak to your line manager, and contact the Emergency Incident Centre (available 24/7).
- If  you  see  something that concerns you at work - Speak to your line manager, a member of the People Team or you can make an anonymous report by contacting a member of the Operational Security Team.
- If you see anything suspicious - If you see something out of the ordinary that worries you at work, talk to your line manager. If you're elsewhere, call the Anti-Terrorist hotline 0800 789 321. And if you think the police should be involved, dial 999 in an emergency or 101 for support.
- If there's a terrorist incident - If there's an incident, Government security guidance provides three principles to follow. But remember, the most important thing to do is to keep yourself safe don't do anything that could put you or anyone else in harm's way.
1. First, try to run - If it's safe to and there's a clear route, get away from the threat. Take other people with you if you can and leave your personal belongings behind.
- 2 If you can't run, hide - Find cover out of view of any attacker, and be as quiet as possible. Remember to make sure your phone is silent. If you can, lock or barricade yourself in and move away from doors and windows.
3. When you're safe, tell - When it's safe to, call 999 and give as much information as you can, specifically:
- where the attackers are, and whether they have any hostages
- how many there are, what they look like and if they're armed
- if anyone's hurt and what the situation is where you are
- 4 When the police arrive - At first, the police may not be able to distinguish you from the attackers - they may point guns at you, treat you firmly and ask you questions. Try to stay calm, avoid sudden movements and keep your hands visible. Follow their instructions, and don't do anything to hinder their progress.

Asda colleagues should be able to come to  work  without fear of  violence, aggression, abuse or harassment and our  customers  should  have  a  safe  place  to  shop.  There  is  zero  tolerance towards any violence and aggression directed at colleagues and we are committed to reducing  and  controlling the  risk  through  preventative  measures.  Further  information  can  be found in the Non Violence and Aggression Policy.

Contact the Operational Security Team at lposa@asda.co.uk if you have any questions.

Asda Policies

## Asda Policies

The policies detailed and referred to within this section do not form part of your terms and conditions of employment.

Asda reserves the right to review, amend, replace, or remove existing policies and /  or introduce new policies from time to time to reflect the changing needs of the business and /  or to comply with changes in legislation or other legal  developments.

## Absence / Attendance

We understand that absence from work can sometimes be unavoidable. If you are unable to attend  work you must inform your line manager or another manager within your team by telephone, at the earliest opportunity, and in any event, no later than 9am or two hours before you are due to start work (in the case of shift work).

Failure to notify your absence correctly may affect sick pay claims and may also result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. When you have been absent from work you must contact your line manager on the day before you intend returning to advise them of this.

## During your absence from work:

- Following notification of your absence, you will receive a return phone call from your line manager.
- Welfare visits will be made during your absence if it is prolonged. Visits will usually take place at the store, however in some instances a home visit may be necessary. Where possible, visits will be arranged in line with your contractual hours and medical reports may be requested to understand more about your medical condition and / or reason for absence. Refusal to attend a store visit, allow a home visit or allow us to obtain medical reports may mean that we have to make a decision regarding your employment without relevant and current information.
- On your return to work you will have a Return to Work Interview with your line manager.

We monitor absence so that all cases are dealt with fairly and consistently. In cases of persistent regular absence and/or where absence causes a concern, this will be managed in line with the Attendance Policy.

Absences that occur within your probationary period will be treated seriously as we would not expect you to be absent during this time without good reason. If more than one absence has occurred during your probationary period, it may lead to an unsatisfactory probationary review and may result in the termination of your contract. Further information can be found in both the Attendance and Wellbeing Policies.

## Occupational Health

Occupational Health is a service used in cases where additional medical advice is needed where a medical condition is impacting on your ability to carry out your role. If you are referred to Occupational Health, you will be expected to discuss your condition with a health care professional. This could be face to face or via telephone. Our Occupational Health providers are medically trained professionals and give independent advice and guidance on how we can support you. Asda will cover the cost of this service. If you unreasonably refuse to attend an appointment, Asda reserves the right to withhold company sick pay at our discretion. Further information can be found in the Health and Wellbeing Policy.

## Absent Without Leave (AWOL)

If you fail to report your absence, it will be taken very seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Further information can be found in the AWOL Policy.

## Criminal Convictions

In 2020 Asda removed the question asking candidates about their criminal convictions form the online application process. The aim of this is to provide all applicants with the same opportunities to gain employment regardless of their background or past.

Candidates will only need to disclose a criminal conviction if they have applied for a role that requires a Safeguarding check. This will be detailed in your Offer Letter.

If a candidate does disclose that they have a criminal conviction, it does not automatically prevent them from being offered a role with Asda. In all cases where a candidate has declared an unspent criminal conviction, a discussion must take place as part of the recruitment process. Further information can be found in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Policy

## Disciplinary

As an Asda colleague there are certain expectations when it comes to your behaviour and conduct both at work and during functions or social events that have been organised by Asda or Asda colleagues.

Whilst we are sure that your behaviour will be in line with Asda's expectations, and that you will adhere to Asda policies, any conduct related issues or breaches of policy will be treated seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Further information can be found in the Disciplinary Policy.

## Dress Standards

Maintaining a smart and presentable standard of dress at all times is really important at Asda. As a colleague you are an ambassador of the Asda brand and that's how we want you to look and feel.

You are required to comply with dress standards at all times which, for reasons that include health and safety regulations, may vary depending on where you work. If you are visiting a location within Asda where you do not usually work, you must ensure that you comply with the dress standards for that specific area of the business. Further information can be found in the Dress Standards Policy.

## Ethics

As an Asda colleague, you must act honestly, openly, fairly and in accordance with the law. Our values are at the heart of our business and as such we must all treat each other, customers and suppliers with respect and always act in the best interests of the business.

It's really important that you familiarise yourself with the Statement of Ethics document, which is on the People Policies page on the colleague intranet. The document describes situations that may arise in your role and how you should deal with any concerns that you might have about doing the right thing.

Whilst this guide cannot cover everything, the documents, along with the points below, will help you to understand what we expect from you and everyone who works for Asda when it comes to acting ethically.

Any concerns must be escalated to the Ethics Team confidentially on ethics@asda.co.uk or anonymously via Expolink, our third party reporting line on 0800 318 405.

## Anti-Bribery

At Asda (as is made clear in the Accountability Statement) we do not tolerate, permit, or engage in bribery, corruption, improper payments, or unethical practices of any kind.

Bribery is one of the seven Immediately Reportable Ethics Criteria, and any concerns must be raised with the Ethics Team immediately.

## Conflict of Interest

You are expected to act in the best interests of Asda at all times and so it is important that your judgement is not influenced, or might appear as being influenced, by the possibility of personal benefit. If you think there is any possibility that your specific circumstances may cause a conflict of interest, you must inform your line manager immediately. Managers are encouraged to bring possible conflict concerns to the attention of Asda Ethics for advice.

## Employment of Friends and Relatives

Relatives may work alongside each other in a store, depot, or office. However, there is a conflict of interest if you manage someone with whom you have a family or romantic relationship. Even if you're acting properly, your relationship is likely to be seen by others as influencing your judgement. This can damage morale and disrupt workplace productivity. Therefore you may not directly or indirectly supervise family members or any colleague with whom you have a close personal relationship or are romantically involved. You should ask for guidance from your manager or contact Asda Ethics whenever an issue comes up.

## Gifts from Suppliers

Accepting gifts and entertainment can cause a conflict between your personal interests and your role at Asda. Asda's culture is to never accept gifts or entertainment from any supplier, potential supplier, government agent, charity or other third party that you think may be trying to influence your business judgement.

You should always be aware of how the act of accepting a gift might be viewed by the public, by other suppliers or other colleagues. You should ask yourself 'would this business offer me this gift or gratuity if I wasn't working for Asda?' If the answer is 'no' or unclear, you should not accept it.

You should not accept a gift or gratuity from a customer for work performed in any Asda premises.

## Payment to Government Officials

As an Asda colleague, you must not make, or offer to make, directly or indirectly a payment to a government official.

## Political Activities

You are free to take an active interest in politics in your own time. However, with the exception of lobbying for changes in legislation, Asda will not become associated with a political party to promote Asda's interests to the government or any opposition party or build relationships with MPs and other officials who influence the regions in which Asda stores operate.

## Flexible Working

We understand that in order to balance work commitments with your personal life you may wish to request to work flexibly. There are a range of flexible working options open to you, which will help you to find the perfect work-life fit between your individual needs and meeting your objectives at work. Further information can be found in the Flexible Working Policies.

## Grievance

It is important to us that you enjoy coming to work and we hope that you don't experience any problems. However any concerns that are raised will be listened to and acted upon. It is really important that you speak to your manager or a member of your leadership team if you experience any issues, to allow them to act promptly. In the first instance we may explore mediation as an  informal method to address your concern. Further  information  can be found in the Grievance Policy.

## Leaving Asda

We're sure that you will enjoy working for Asda and want to stay with us for a long time. However, if the time comes for you to leave, a process will be followed to ensure your exit from the business is smooth and uncomplicated. This will include exploring the reasons behind your decision to leave, checking how many holidays you have taken and arranging for the return of any Asda property such as uniform, locker keys, swipe cards etc.

Asda reserves the right to charge colleagues for any property such as laptops, mobile devices, uniform, locker keys, cards etc that have not been returned. Further information can be found in the Leavers Policy.

## Mobile Phones

We have certain expectations at Asda when it comes to using mobile phones and the Mobile Phones Policy and the Bring Your Own Device Policy sets out what is required of you. It is important that you understand what these expectations are.

If you are required to drive a vehicle as part of your job role, it is important that you understand the consequence of using any hand-held mobile or other device whilst driving a company vehicle.

Improper use of mobile devices both inside and outside of the workplace or whilst driving a company vehicle will be taken very seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Further information on mobile phone use can be found in the following policies:

- Mobile Phones Policy
- Bring Your Own Device Policy

## Maternity / Paternity / Adoption / Shared Parental Leave

As an Asda colleague, if you have the main responsibility for the upbringing of a child that is born or placed into your care, you may be entitled to certain pay and leave benefits depending on your specific circumstances. There is a process that both you and Asda must follow, which is detailed in the policy relevant to the type of leave you require.

If you are approached by anyone claiming to be from the press or media and asked to give a statement on Asda's behalf, you must decline to comment and inform your line manager immediately.

## Safeguarding

Depending on the type of role you carry out at Asda, you may be required to have a safeguarding check, which shows details of previous criminal convictions.

## Substance Misuse

At Asda, we take our responsibility to provide a safe and healthy working environment seriously. The misuse of alcohol and drugs may jeopardise this.

You must not possess, use, or sell illegal drugs, legal highs, or alcohol whilst on company premises or whilst carrying out work activities. You must not consume alcoholic drinks on Asda premises, including at a function or event organised by Asda, unless specific authority has been given and the alcohol has been made available by Asda.

Any colleague suffering from a substance dependency problem or addiction who comes forward and asks for help will receive support.

Further information can be found in the Substance Misuse Policy.

## Whistle Blowing

Whistleblowing means raising a concern or reporting a type of wrongdoing in the workplace. We would expect and encourage you to bring to our attention any concerns you have about possible illegal  or  unsafe  practices  or  any  wrongdoing  that  may  threaten  the  public  or  Asda's interests. Any concerns raised will be treated confidentially.

If you fail to disclose information relating to serious or dangerous malpractice including safety, security, or dishonesty it will be regarded as a very serious matter and may result in disciplinary action  up  to  and  including  dismissal.
